[0.000000] [smpi_config/INFO] You did not set the power of the host running the simulation.  The timings will certainly not be accurate.  Use the option "--cfg=smpi/host-speed:<flops>" to set its value.  Check https://simgrid.org/doc/latest/Configuring_SimGrid.html#automatic-benchmarking-of-smpi-code for more information.
